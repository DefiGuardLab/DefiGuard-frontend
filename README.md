# 🛡️ DefiGuard

DefiGuard is a decentralized DeFi insurance protocol built on Starknet that enables users to buy smart contract cover for protocols like Aave, Uniswap, Compound, and more.

Our mission is to provide trustless, censorship-resistant, and transparent protection for DeFi participants through a pool-based coverage system powered by smart contracts.

## **🔍 Overview**

DefiGuard allows users to:

- Buy coverage for specific DeFi protocols
- Receive Policy NFTs that represent their insurance rights
- Earn passive income by underwriting risk through pool creation
- Protect against risks like smart contract hacks, oracle failures, and governance attacks

Adapted for the Starknet ecosystem, DefiGuard offers protocol-level cover with transparent risk allocation and onchain claims handling.

## **🌍 Ecosystem & Integrations**

- Starknet – scalable L2 for all smart contracts
- Chainlink (planned) – for pricing feeds and protocol metrics
- IPFS/Filecoin (planned) – decentralized metadata and file storage
